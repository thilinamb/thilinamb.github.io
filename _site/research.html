  	<h3>Data Stream Processing</h3>

<p>Data Stream Processing is a gaining a lot of traction due to the real time processing requirements of the continuous series of data generated by the sensors, monitoring systems, social networks, etc. Traditional store-then-process models such as relational databases and MapReduce frameworks are not feasible in these situations due to the storage complexities and the high latency associated with those systems. A new breed of systems called &quot;data stream processing systems&quot; has emerged to process continuous data streams in real time and near real time.</p>

<p>Security and stream processing systems is often an overlooked area. We have proposed an information flow control model for stream processing systems based on <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=36295&amp;tag=1">Chinese Wall security policy</a>. This will prevent overt and covert information channels and ensures that only the authorized entities can access data items they are entitled to. We have developed a prototype based on an open source complex event processing engine called <a href="http://wso2.com/products/complex-event-processor/">Siddhi</a> to demonstrate our model is practical to use in real time stream processing use cases.</p>

<p>Distributed stream processing in heterogeneous environments is another related project that we&#39;ve been working on. The objective is to distribute stream processing in a heterogeneous network which is comprised of processing nodes with different capabilities which are connected through links which are again heterogeneous with respect to their bandwidth and connectivity. The distributed processing plan should improve the bandwidth utilization while meeting the low latency processing requirement.</p>

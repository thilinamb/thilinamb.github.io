## About Me
I am Thilina Buddhika, a Ph.D student at [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.colostate.edu) at [Colorado State University](http://www.colostate.edu) since Fall, 2013. My primary research interests are distributed systems and large scale data processing in general. Recently I've been focusing on distributed data stream processing applications and complex event processing systems. I am a member of Distributed Systems Group under the supervision of [Dr. Shrideep Pallickara](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~shrideep/).

Before starting my graduate studies, I worked as a software engineer at [WSO2 Inc.,](http://wso2.com) which is an open source SOA middleware company for more than three years.
During that period, I was mainly working on web services and service oriented architectures, enterprise application integration and their security aspects.
I am a committer and a project management committee member for [Apache Axis2](http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/), a popular open source SOAP engine.

I earned my bachelors degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa](http://www.cse.mrt.ac.lk), Sri Lanka in 2009.

I was born and raised in the beautiful island of [Sri Lanka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsDG-FdW0is). I am a big fan of [Cricket](http://www.srilankacricket.lk/) and a passive listener of music.
